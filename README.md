# Haven
Haven is a family violence information/crisis tab that can be embedded into a website and will not show in browser history

This is heavily inspired by the New Zealand operation https://shielded.co.nz/

The goal is to make this applicable to Australian customers and build it as expandable as possible

Simply add the following to any website where ever you would like:
```
<script type="tex/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/glassesarms/haven@main/src/app.js"></script>
<img id="haven-photo" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/glassesarms/haven@main/src/assets/logo.svg" alt="Haven" style="border-radius: 50%; margin: 0px auto; display: block; cursor: pointer;" width="50px" height="50px"/>
```
